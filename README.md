This is my personal portfolio website built with React.js and Tailwindcss, showcasing my skills and projects. The website is designed and created entirely by me, Rahul Vijay.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive:** The website is fully responsive and works flawlessly on all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.

- **Modern Design:** The portfolio website features a modern and visually appealing design, utilizing animations to add an interactive touch to the user interface.
